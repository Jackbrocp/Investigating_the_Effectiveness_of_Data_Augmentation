# Investigating the Effectiveness of Data Augmentation from Similarity and Diversity: An Empirical Study
This is the official implementation of the paper "Investigating the Effectiveness of Data Augmentation from Similarity and Diversity: An Empirical Study", as was used for the paper.
We release all the codes of our work (both for embedding model training and metric computation).

You can directly start off using our implementations.
## Usage
- Clone this directory and `cd`  into it.
 
`git clone https://github.com/Jackbrocp/Investing_the_Effectiveness_of_Data_Augmentation` 

`cd Investing_the_Effectiveness_of_Data_Augmentation`

## Updates
- 2023/9/: Initial release

## Getting Started
### Requirements
- Python 3
- PyTorch 1.6.0
- Torchvision 0.7.0
- Numpy
- see requirement.txt
<!-- Install a fitting Pytorch version for your setup with GPU support, as our implementation  -->
